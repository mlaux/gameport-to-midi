# game port to MIDI adapter

This adapter allows the connection of MIDI devices to the 'game port' or joystick port found on old sound cards. It's similar to the reference circuit given in the MIDI specification, but obsolete parts have been replaced with modern equivalents.

KiCad schematic and layout files are provided, as well as three custom footprints (the DIN-5 MIDI connector, the DB-15 game port connector, and the MIDI logo).
